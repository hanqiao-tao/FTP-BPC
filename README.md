# FTP-BPC
This repository includes the test instances, source codes, and computational results for the **flight test planning (FTP) problem** introduced in [1].

If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to contact taohanqiao19@nudt.edu.cn.

## Instances
All test instances used in this work are stored in the "Instances" folder, with the directory structure detailed as follows.

## Algorithm
This repository implements a branch-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm for exactly solving the FTP.

- The algorithm is implemented in C++ and executed in single-threaded mode. The full source code will be publicly released after the first round of peer review.
- All mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations in this work are solved using the Cardinal Optimizer (COPT) 7.2.11 [4] via its C++ API. The solver is configured to run in single-threaded mode, with all other parameters set to their default values.
- This code has the following required dependencies:
  - **Boost ≥ 1.80.0**   (https://www.boost.org/)
  - **xxHash**           (https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash)
- We gratefully acknowledge Prof. Jordi Pereira for kindly sharing the source code developed in his work [5], which supported the development of this implementation.
- We adopt the combo algorithm proposed in [6] for solving 0-1 knapsack problem in the separation procedure.

## Computational Results
Full computational results for all test instances are documented in the Excel file "FTP results.xlsx".
